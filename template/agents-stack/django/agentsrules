# Stack Rules — Django

Django web framework rules emphasizing security, ORM best practices, and scalable architecture patterns.

## Key Principles

- **Security First**: CSRF, SQL injection, XSS protection built-in
- **ORM Over Raw SQL**: Leverage Django's powerful ORM for maintainability
- **MVT Pattern**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Performance**: Query optimization, caching, async support
- **DRF for APIs**: Django REST Framework for RESTful services
