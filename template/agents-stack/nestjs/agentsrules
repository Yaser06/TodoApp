# Stack Rules — NestJS

TypeScript backend framework built on Express/Fastify. Emphasizes dependency injection, modularity, and enterprise patterns.

## Key Principles

- **Dependency Injection**: Constructor-based, testable
- **Modular Architecture**: Feature modules, clear separation
- **TypeScript First**: Full type safety
- **Decorator-Based**: Clean, declarative syntax
- **Production-Ready**: Guards, pipes, interceptors, filters
