# Stack Rules — Vue3/Nuxt

Modern Vue 3 with Nuxt 3 framework. Emphasizes Composition API, TypeScript, and SSR-optimized data fetching.

## Key Principles

- **Composition API Only**: Modern, reusable, type-safe
- **Auto-Import**: Nuxt 3's magic for components and composables
- **SSR-First**: Server-side rendering for performance and SEO
- **TypeScript**: Strict typing for reliability
- **Tailwind + Shadcn**: Rapid UI development
